#Working with Strings
#how to use strings 
phrase = 'Giraffe Academy'
print (phrase.lower()) #how to check for lower case letters
print (phrase.upper()) #how to check for upper case(capital letters)
print(prase.isupper()) #allows the terminal to check and will give a true and false value
print (phrase.upper.isupper())

print(len(phrase)) #tells you how many characters there are within a string#
print(phrase[0]) #in python indexes within a string will always start with 0 e.g 0123 what number I choose determines the character chosen
int (phrase.index('G')) #counts the charcters for you
print(phrase.replace('hello world', 'bye  plane'))#this allows you to replace the words through the terminal

# next tutorial is working with number and maybe data types
